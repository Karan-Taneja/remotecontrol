# REMOTE CONTROL

*A series of services and apps for teaching remote courses.*

The purpose of this repo is to provide references to functions, bots and apps (refered to from here on out as *"services"*) developed to aid in the teaching of remote courses. In spirit these services will be written to be organization agnostic. Ideally they should be usable freely and easily within any organization (General Assembly, NYCDA, etc). However services can and likely will require prerequisites such as slack tokens or API keys in order to properly function. As a general rule of thumb, all services should be easily deployable by forking a repo and following set up instructions. Optionally, some services may be deployed and open to free use by larger community - these decisions will be made on a service-by-service basis and uptime / support of the for-community deployed services are not gaurunteed.
