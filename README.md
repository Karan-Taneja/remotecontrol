# REMOTE CONTROL

*A series of services and apps for teaching remote courses.*

The purpose of this repo is to provide references to functions, bots and apps (refered to from here on out as *"services"*) developed to aid in the teaching of remote courses. Although in spirit these services are organization agnostic, in practice they will initially be tightly coupled with teaching methodologies and practices developed at General Assembly.
